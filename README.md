# Menu-and-Tipping-App
This project is an application that allows a user to scan a QR code that will display a screen with two options. One option is to view the Menu, which lists available drink options and the description of each. The other option is Tip, which allows the user to tip the bartender.

There is a variety of payment methods including PayPal, Venmo, and credit/debit card.
